Hi Christopher,

I've fixed the critical automation issues tonight. Here's what's been addressed:

✅ **Automation now stops completely after agreement is sent**
- Once an agreement is sent, the system will NOT respond to any further messages in that thread
- This fixes the issue with ben-riley@thomasriley.net and similar cases

✅ **Automation stops after 2 messages (not 1)**
- Updated threshold from 1 to 2 auto-replies as you requested

✅ **New confidence-based system**
- System only auto-responds when confidence is ≥90%
- More conservative - fewer errors, only responds to clear intents

**What this fixes:**
- No more automated replies after agreement sent (prevents "looking bad" scenario)
- Allows 2 messages before stopping (better conversation flow)
- Reduced errors through confidence-based decisions

All critical fixes are complete and ready for testing. The system should now behave exactly as you requested.

Let me know if you want to test or have any questions.
